# Camerax_ImageCapture_Chaquopy_OpenCV_ImageResolution

CameraX and Chaquopy show image resolution of Image Capture.
Application made in Android Studio CameraX.
Capture image, send it to Chaquopy(Python) like a string,and Python with OpenCV return image resolution.

App is very very slow.
Any suggestions for speeding up, will be welcomed..

Special thanks to people from who I learned a lot:
